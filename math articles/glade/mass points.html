          <p>
            A <b>mass point</b> is of the form $aP$ where
            <u><em>a</em> is the mass of a point <em>P</em></u
            >. The mass of any mass point must be positive and real.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Since math problems generally only provide lengths of ratios of
          lengths, it is often up to the reader to assign a value for $a$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mass points are most commonly used for triangles, but they can be used
          for just about any polygon, since all polygons can be decomposed into
          triangles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of a mass point is based on the physics concept of torque,
          specifically <em>Archimedes' Law of the Lever</em>. This has to do
          with rotation and can be visualized as a seesaw, as we will see in the
          next toggle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a quick notation tip to avoid notation abuse: use lowercase
          letters for mass values and an uppercase equivalent to denote the
          corresponding point. This means that "$a$" could be the mass of a
          point labeled "$A$."

          Now that we know what mass points are, let's take a look at why
          they're useful! But before we get started, it would be worthwhile to
          understand the motivation behind where mass points come from. Let's
          take a look at Archimedes' Law of the Lever.
        </p>
        <div class="theorem">
          <div class="thmname">Archimedes' Law of the Lever</div>
          <p>
            Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional
            to their weights.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Don't worry if that was confusing. To better understand this, consider
          the seesaw illustrated below. Different masses are placed on the two
          ends. In order to keep the seesaw in equilibrium, heavier masses must
          be placed <b>closer</b> to the fulcrum (the point that the seesaw is
          resting on) and lighter masses must be placed <b>farther</b> away. The
          product of each mass and its distance to the fulcrum must be the same.
        </p>
        <center>
          <img src="https://bit.ly/2QTMrH3" alt="Picture of Fulcrum" />
        </center>
        <p>
          In the above image, Archimedes' Law of the Lever states that
          $m_1d_1=m_2d_2$.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with all of our other diagrams, this is only a sketch and is not to
          scale. The boxes are there for illustrative purposes and are supposed
          to represent mass points. In practice, more massive points on the
          seesaw would not take up more physical space. (After all, all points
          are technically the same size.) Thus, from a purely mathematical
          perspective, each distance $d_i$ should be the distance from each mass
          point to the fulcrum.
        </p>
        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">Center of Mass</div>
          <p>
            Given a system of objects, the <b>center of mass</b> gives the
            average location of those objects with respect to each object's
            mass. Every system of mass points has a unique center of mass.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Think of it as a "balancing point." (In physics, we often treat large
          or irregularly shaped objects as having all of their mass located at
          their center of mass.) For example, if we have a system of two
          identical mass points, their center of mass will be located right in
          between them. On the contrary, if one of those points is heavier than
          the other, the center of mass will be located closer to the heavier
          point.
        </p>
        <div class="theorem">
          <div class="thmname">Mass Point Addition</div>
          <p>
            Supoise we have mass points $aP$ and $bQ$. Let their center of mass
            be point $R$. Then $R$ has a mass of $a+b.$
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Archimedes' Law of the Lever tells us that $$a(PR)=b(RQ),$$ so $R$
          must be located such that $$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{RQ}{PR}.$$
        </p>
        <p>Also, mass point addition is both commutative and associative.</p>
        <p>
          We can also extend this property to include mass point subtraction. To
          do this, suppose that we were instead given two mass points $cP$ and
          $dR$, with $d>c$. We can then subtract them to find the mass of a
          third point $Q$, located on the other side of $R$ opposite $P$:
          $$dR-cP = (d-c)Q.$$ In other words, the center of mass of mass points
          $cP$ and ($d-c)Q$ is $dR$, where $R$ is located in between $P$ and
          $Q$.

      <div style="display: none">
        <p>
          We just established the idea of balancing a "seesaw" to find the
          center of mass of two mass points. But what if we've got three or four
          mass points? Or even more than that? Luckily, the mass points
          technique can easily be extended to systems of lots of points. For
          example, most basic mass points problems involve triangles,
          specifically cevians:
        </p>
        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">The Cevian</div>
          <p>
            For a given triangle $ABC$, a <b>cevian</b> is a line segment from
            one vertex to the opposing side. The term "cevian" is very broad and
            can include angle bisectors, medians, perpendicular bisectors, etc.
            (Note that not all perpendicular bisectors are cevians because they
            don't necessarily go through one of the triangle's vertices.)
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>In the image below, $AD$ is a cevian of $\triangle ABC$.</p>
        <center>
          <img src="https://bit.ly/3f250Rk" alt="Picture of Cevian" />
        </center>
        <p>
          When solving basic mass points problems, you'll often be given a
          triangle with a few cevians where you have to find a specific ratio of
          lengths. To do this, let the intersection of those cevians be the
          triangle's center of mass. Then you'll be able to treat each cevian as
          a "seesaw" and assign weights to the triangle's vertices accordingly.

        <p>
          Now we know how to assign mass points to triangles with cevians, but
          what if we're not dealing with cevians? What if we're dealing with
          lines that still intersect the triangle but don't go through any of
          its vertices? In this case, you're probably wondering about
          transversals:
        </p>
        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">The Transversal</div>
          <p>
            A <b>transversal</b> is a line intersecting two distinct lines at
            two distinct points.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the image below, $DE$ is a transversal because it intersects $AB$
          and $AC$ at points $D$ and $E$.
        </p>
        <center>
          <img src="https://bit.ly/3uySXSa" alt="Picture of Transversal" />
        </center>
        <p>To address these scenarios, use the following method:</p>
        <p>
          Imagine that sides $AB$ and $AC$ are separate "seesaws" with fulcrums
          at $D$ and $E$. See how point $A$ is suddenly a part of two different
          seesaws? This means that $A$ will have a split mass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pretend that $A$ is made up of two points stuck together: $A_1$ and
          $A_2$. $A_1$ and $B$ constitute a set of mass points with $D$ as their
          center of mass, while $A_2$ and $C$ constitute a separate set of mass
          points with $E$ as their center of mass.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now suppose that $A_1$ has a mass of $x$ and $A_2$ has a mass of $y$.
          Now we can just add those two mass points to find the mass of point
          $A$: $$xA_1+yA_2=(x+y)A,$$ so the mass of $A$ is just $x+y$.
        </p>

          Mass points problems often start with a diagram and some ratios of
          lengths. These ratios can help you determine what masses to assign to
          which points. After that, Archimedes' Law of the Lever can be used to
          figure out remaining ratios of lengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          When dealing with cevians of a triangle, treat their intersection as
          the triangle's center of mass and use Archimedes' Law of the Lever on
          each cevian.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider assigning masses that are multiples of the given lengths or
          ratios of lengths to make your calculations easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          When annotating diagrams, it can be useful to circle your mass values
          on your diagrams to avoid confusing them with lengths. We will do this
          for the example problems.

          <b>Important note:</b> from here on, we'll denote all points with
          capital letters and their respective masses with their lowercase
          equivalents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let $a=1$ for simplicity. We're given that $\dfrac{AC}{CE}=3$. This
          means that $\dfrac{AE}{CE}=2$ because $AE+EC=AC$. Using the properties
          of mass points, we have that $$AE\cdot a = EC \cdot c \Rightarrow
          \frac{AE}{EC}=\frac{c}{a} \Rightarrow c =
          a\left(\dfrac{AE}{EC}\right)$$ which means that $c=1(2)=2$.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also know that $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $\dfrac{BD}{DC}=1$.
          This means that $b=c$, so $b=2$. Since $D$ lies between $B$ and $C$
          and we already know that $b=c=2$, we have that $$d = b+c = 4.$$ We're
          almost done. We use Archimedes' Law of the Lever one more time:
          $$\frac{AG}{GD}=\frac{d}{a}=\frac{4}{1}=\boxed{4}.$$

          As with the previous example, we let $a=1$. We know that $AE=EB$
          because $CE$ is a median. This means that $b=1$ as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          We follow similar steps to show that $c=1$ because $AD$ is also a
          median. It follows that $$d=e=1+1=2$$ because of mass point addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we consider the relationship between $AP$ and $PD$. This problem
          is simple enough that we don't need to compare ratios algebraically,
          so instead we'll use the seesaw analogy from the theory section.
          Remember that the mass of each point is inversely proportional to its
          distance from the fulcrum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let $P$ be the fulcrum of "seesaws" $AD$ and $CE$. Since $a$ is half
          the mass of $d$, $a$ must be twice as far away from the fulcrum. This
          means that $AP=4$ because we're given that $PD=2$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, we see that $E$ must be half as far away from the fulcrum as
          $C$ because $E$ has twice the mass of $C$. This means that $CP=3$
          because $EP=1.5$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost there. Note that $\triangle DPE$ is just a $3-4-5$ right
          triangle scaled down by one-half, where $\angle DPE = 90^\circ$. This
          means that the diagonals of $AEDC$ are perpendicular. Therefore, its
          area is $$\frac{AD \cdot CE}{2} = \frac{4.5(6)}{2}=\boxed{13.5}.$$
          (The area of $AECD$ can also be found by adding up areas of the four
          right triangles comprising it.)
        </p>
        <p>
          An annotated diagram for this problem is shown below. As with the

          We start by labeling our diagram with the given information. We know
          that $AC=450$ and $K$ is its midpoint, so $AK=CK=225$. We're also
          given that $CL$ bisects $\angle C$, so we can use the angle bisector
          theorem on $\triangle ABC$:
          $$\frac{BL}{AL}=\frac{BC}{AC}\Rightarrow\frac{BL}{AL}=\frac{300}{450}\Rightarrow
          3BL=2AL$$
        </p>
        <p>
          This suggests that we let $a=2$ and $b=3$ so that our mass point
          ratios will involve integers. We also have $c=2$ because $AK=CK$.
        </p>
        <p>
          From mass point addition, we see that $k=a+c=4$, $p=k+b=7$, and
          $l=a+b=5$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since $L$ has $5/2$ the mass of $C$, it must be $2/5$ as far from $P$.
          In other words, $LP=\dfrac25 CP$. If we can just find $CP$, we'll be
          good to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're given that $MK=KP$ and $AK=CK$ and we know that vertical angles
          $AKM$ and $CKP$ are equal, so $\triangle AKM \cong \triangle CKP.$
          This means that $AM=CP$. We're given that $AM = 180$. Thus, we have
          $$LP=\frac25CP=\frac25(180)=\boxed{72}.$$
        </p>
        <p>
          An annotated diagram for this problem is shown below. The masses are
          circled.
