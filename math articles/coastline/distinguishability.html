      <div style="display: none">
        <p>First of all, let's define distinguishability.</p>
        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">Distinguishability</div>
          <p>
            If a group of objects do not look alike, they are distinguishable.
            Otherwise, they are indistinguishable.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          For example, a red and blue ball are distinguishable because they have
          different color, but two red balls are not distinguishable because
          they are both the same color.
        </p>
        <p>asdf</p>
        <p>
          Often, one of the first questions you should ask yourself after
          reading a problem is what objects are distinguishable, and which ones
          are distinguishable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important factor to consider when reading a problem is
          repetition. Are you allowed to do the same thing twice?
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine that we're in a sandwhich shop at the beeach. Let's take a
          look on how distinguishability and repetition affect how we can pick
          our sandwhiches.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Distinguishable Ingredients, Ingredient Repetition Allowed  -->
      <div class="toggle">
        Distinguishable Ingredients, Ingredient Repetition Allowed
      </div>
      <div style="display: none">
        <p>
          Let's say the shop allows us to put $k$ of the ingredients onto our
          sandwhich. Since the ingredients are stacked on each other, the order
          they are put on is distinguishable and thus are distinguishable.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first ingredient, we can pick any of the $n$ ingredients. For
          the second ingredient, we can still pick any of the $n$ ingredients
          because repetition is allowed. For the $1\le i\le k$ ingredient, we
          can still pick $n$ ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, there are $$\underbrace{n\cdot n \cdot n\cdot ... \cdot
          n}_{k\text{ ingredients}}=n^k$$ possible sandwhiches.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Distinguishable Ingredients, Ingredient Repetition Allowed  -->
      <div class="toggle">
        Distinguishable Ingredients, Ingredient Repetition Not Allowed
      </div>
      <div style="display: none">
        <p>
          We've finally eaten all of the $n^k$ sandwhiches, but we're still
          hungry. We return back to the store, ready to order the same thing.
          However, the sandwhich shop changed it's menu! Now, we cannot order
          the same ingredient twice. How many distinguishable sandwhiches can we
          order now? Let's take a look at factorials before we tackle this
          problem.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">Factorial</div>
          <p>$$n!=(n)\cdot(n-1)\cdot(n-2)\cdot \cdot \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          If $k=n$ in our problem, this is what happens! We have $n$ objects for
          the first choice. For the second choice, we can choose everything
          other than the first choice, so we have $n-1$ choices. For the $i$th
          choice, we can choose anything other than the $i-1$ previous choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the world is not always simple and $k\neq n$ at the
          sandwhich shop. What happens now?
        </p>
        <p>
          Notice that the start is the same. However, the ending is different.
          Instead of going all the way to $1$, we go to $n-k+1$ because we can
          only choose $k$ ingredients there are $k$ ingredients between $n$ and
          $n-k+1$ inclusive.
        </p>
        <p>This leads us to our definition of permutations</p>
        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">Permutation</div>
          <p>A permutation $(n,k)$ is equal to $$\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$$</p>

          <b>Important note:</b> from here on, we'll denote all points with
          capital letters and their respective masses with their lowercase
          equivalents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let $a=1$ for simplicity. We're given that $\dfrac{AC}{CE}=3$. This
          means that $\dfrac{AE}{CE}=2$ because $AE+EC=AC$. Using the properties
          of mass points, we have that $$AE\cdot a = EC \cdot c \Rightarrow
          \frac{AE}{EC}=\frac{c}{a} \Rightarrow c =
          a\left(\dfrac{AE}{EC}\right)$$ which means that $c=1(2)=2$.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also know that $D$ is the midpoint of $BC$, so $\dfrac{BD}{DC}=1$.
          This means that $b=c$, so $b=2$. Since $D$ lies between $B$ and $C$
          and we already know that $b=c=2$, we have that $$d = b+c = 4.$$ We're
          almost done. We use Archimedes' Law of the Lever one more time:
          $$\frac{AG}{GD}=\frac{d}{a}=\frac{4}{1}=\boxed{4}.$$

        <p>A completed diagram with the labeled masses is shown below:</p>

        <p>
          As with the previous example, we let $a=1$. We know that $AE=EB$
          because $CE$ is a median. This means that $b=1$ as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          We follow similar steps to show that $c=1$ because $AD$ is also a
          median. It follows that $$d=e=1+1=2$$ because of mass point addition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we consider the relationship between $AP$ and $PD$. This problem
          is simple enough that we don't need to compare ratios algebraically,
          so instead we'll use the seesaw analogy from the theory section.
          Remember that the mass of each point is inversely proportional to its
          distance from the fulcrum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let $P$ be the fulcrum of "seesaws" $AD$ and $CE$. Since $a$ is half
          the mass of $d$, $a$ must be twice as far away from the fulcrum. This
          means that $AP=4$ because we're given that $PD=2$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Likewise, we see that $E$ must be half as far away from the fulcrum as
          $C$ because $E$ has twice the mass of $C$. This means that $CP=3$
          because $EP=1.5$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Almost there. Note that $\triangle DPE$ is just a $3-4-5$ right
          triangle scaled down by one-half, where $\angle DPE = 90^\circ$. This
          means that the diagonals of $AEDC$ are perpendicular. Therefore, its
          area is $$\frac{AD \cdot CE}{2} = \frac{4.5(6)}{2}=\boxed{13.5}.$$
          (The area of $AECD$ can also be found by adding up areas of the four
          right triangles comprising it.)
        </p>
        <p>
          An annotated diagram for this problem is shown below. As with the
          previous example, the masses are circled.

          We start by labeling our diagram with the given information. We know
          that $AC=450$ and $K$ is its midpoint, so $AK=CK=225$. We're also
          given that $CL$ bisects $\angle C$, so we can use the angle bisector
          theorem on $\triangle ABC$:
          $$\frac{BL}{AL}=\frac{BC}{AC}\Rightarrow\frac{BL}{AL}=\frac{300}{450}\Rightarrow
          3BL=2AL$$
        </p>
        <p>
          This suggests that we let $a=2$ and $b=3$ so that our mass point
          ratios will involve integers. We also have $c=2$ because $AK=CK$.
        </p>
        <p>
          From mass point addition, we see that $k=a+c=4$, $p=k+b=7$, and
          $l=a+b=5$.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since $L$ has $5/2$ the mass of $C$, it must be $2/5$ as far from $P$.
          In other words, $LP=\dfrac25 CP$. If we can just find $CP$, we'll be
          good to go.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're given that $MK=KP$ and $AK=CK$ and we know that vertical angles
          $AKM$ and $CKP$ are equal, so $\triangle AKM \cong \triangle CKP.$
          This means that $AM=CP$. We're given that $AM = 180$. Thus, we have
          $$LP=\frac25CP=\frac25(180)=\boxed{72}.$$
