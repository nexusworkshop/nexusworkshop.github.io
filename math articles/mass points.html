          <div class="defname">Mass Point</div>
          We define a <b>mass point</b> to be of the form $aP$ where $a$ is the
          mass of a point $P$. The mass of any mass point must be positive and
          real.
        </div>
        <p>
          Note that it is often up to the reader to assign a value for $a$ since
          math problems generally only provide lengths or ratios of lengths
          rather than masses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mass points are most commonly used for triangles, but they can be used
          for just about any polygon, since all polygons can be decomposed into
          triangles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of a mass point is based on the physics concept of torque,
          specifically <em>Archimedes' Law of the Lever</em>. This has to do
          with rotation and can be visualized as a seesaw, as we will see in the
          next toggle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quick notation tip: use lowercase letters for mass values and an
          uppercase equivalent to denote the corresponding point. This means
          that "$a$" could be the mass of a point labeled "$A$."

        <p>
          Now that we know what mass points are, let's take a look at why
          they're useful! But before we get started, it would be worthwhile to
          define a few other key terms:

        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">Archimides' Law of the Lever</div>
          Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional
          to their weights.
        </div>
        <p>
          Don't worry if that was confusing. To better understand this, consider
          the seesaw illustrated below. Different masses are placed on the two
          ends. In order to keep the seesaw in equilibrium, heavier masses must
          be placed <b>closer</b> to the fulcrum (the point that the seesaw is
          resting on) and lighter masses must be placed <b>farther</b> away. The
          product of each mass and its distance to the fulcrum must be the same.

          In the above image, Archimedes' Law of the Lever states that

          there for illustrative purposes and are supposed to represent mass
          points. In practice, more massive points on the seesaw would not take
          up more physical space. (After all, all points are technically the
          same size.) Thus, from a purely mathematical perspective, each
          distance $d_i$ should be the distance from each mass point to the
          fulcrum.</em

        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">Center of Mass</div>
          <p>
            Given a system of objects, the center of mass gives the average
            location of those objects with respect to each object's mass.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Think of it as a "balancing point." (In physics, we often treat large
          or irregularly shaped objects as having all of their mass located at
          their center of mass.) For example, if we have a system of two
          identical mass points, their center of mass will be located right in
          between them. On the contrary, if one of those points is heavier than
          the other, the center of mass will be located closer to the heavier
          point. Note that any set of mass points has a unique center of mass.
          --- Archimedes' Law of the Lever and the concept of the center of mass
          help explain the following property of mass points:
        </p>
        <div class="theorem">
          <div class="thmname">Mass Point Addition</div>
          <p>
            Using the notation from Definition 1, suppose we have mass points
            $aP$ and $bQ$. Let their center of mass be point $R$. Then $R$ has a
            mass of $$a+b.$$ Archimedes' Law of the Lever tells us that
            $$a(PR)=b(RQ),$$ so $R$ must be located such that
            $$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{RQ}{PR}.$$
            <em
              >Note that mass point addition is both commutative and
              associative.</em
            >
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          We can also extend this property to include mass point subtraction. To
          do this, suppose that we were instead given two mass points $cP$ and
          $dR$, with $d>c$. We can then subtract them to find the mass of a
          third point $Q$, located on the other side of $R$ opposite $P$:
          $$dR-cP = (d-c)Q.$$ In other words, the center of mass of mass points
          $cP$ and ($d-c)Q$ is $dR$, where $R$ is located in between $P$ and
          $Q$.

<!-- Systems of More than Two Mass Points -->
      <div class="toggle">Systems of More than Two Mass Points</div>
      <div style="display: none">
      <p>
        We just established the idea of balancing a "seesaw" to find the center
        of mass of two mass points. But what if we've got three or four mass
        points? Or even more than that? Luckily, the mass points technique can
        easily be extended to systems of lots of points. For example, most basic
        mass points problems involve triangles, specifically <em>cevians</em> of
        triangles:
      </p>
        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">The Cevian</div>
          For a given triangle $ABC$, a <em>cevian</em> is a line segment from
          one vertex to the opposing side. The term "cevian" is very broad and
          can include angle bisectors, medians, perpendicular bisectors, etc.
          (Note that not all perpendicular bisectors are cevians because they
          don't necessarily go through one of the triangle's vertices.)
        </div>
        <p>In the image below, $AD$ is a cevian of $\triangle ABC$.</p>

          width="75%"
        />
        </center>
        <p>When solving basic mass points problems, you'll often be given a triangle with a few cevians where you have to find a specific ratio of lengths. To do this, let the intersection of those cevians be the triangle's center of mass. Then you'll be able to treat each cevian as a "seesaw" and assign weights to the triangle's vertices accordingly.</p>

        Now we know how to assign mass points to triangles with cevians, but what if we're not dealing with cevians? What if we're dealing with lines that still intersect the triangle but don't go through any of its vertices? 

In this case, you're probably wondering about <em>transversals</em>:
      </p>
        <div class="definition">
          <div class="defname">The Transversal</div>
          A transversal is a line intersecting two distinct lines at two distinct points.

        <p>In the image below, $DE$ is a transversal because it intersects $AB$ and $AC$ at points $D$ and $E$.</p>

        </center>
        <p>To address these scenarios, use the following property:</p>
        <div class="theorem">
        <div class="thmname">Splitting Mass Points</div>
        Once again suppose we have a triangle $ABC$ and a transversal $DE$, as shown in the diagram below.

          <img
          src="https://bit.ly/3uySXSa"
          alt="Picture of Transversal"
          width="75%"
        />
        </center>
        <p>Imagine that sides $AB$ and $AC$ are separate "seesaws" with fulcrums at $D$ and $E$. See how point $A$ is suddenly a part of two different seesaws? This means that $A$ will have a split mass.

Pretend that $A$ is made up of two points stuck together: $A_1$ and $A_2$. $A_1$ and $B$ constitute a set of mass points with $D$ as their center of mass, while $A_2$ and $C$ constitute a separate set of mass points with $E$ as their center of mass.

Now suppose that $A_1$ has a mass of $x$ and $A_2$ has a mass of $y$. Now we can just add those two mass points to find the mass of point $A$:

$$xA_1+yA_2=(x+y)A,$$

so the mass of $A$ is just $x+y$.</p>

        <p> Let $a=1$ for simplicity. We're given that  $\dfrac{AC}{CE}=3$. This means that $\dfrac{AE}{CE}=2$ because $AE+EC=AC$. Using the properties of mass points, we have that 

$$AE\cdot a = EC \cdot c \Rightarrow \frac{AE}{EC}=\frac{c}{a} \Rightarrow c = a\left(\dfrac{AE}{EC}\right)$$

which means that $c=1(2)=2$.</p>

<p>We also know that $D$ is the midpoint of  $BC$, so $\dfrac{BD}{DC}=1$. This means that $b=c$, so $b=2$.

Since $D$ lies between $B$ and $C$ and we already know that $b=c=2$, we have that 

$$d = b+c = 4.$$

We're almost done. We use Archimedes' Law of the Lever one more time:

$$\frac{AG}{GD}=\frac{d}{a}=\frac{4}{1}=\boxed{4}.$$</p>

        <p>As with the previous example, we let $a=1$. We know that $AE=EB$ because $CE$ is a median. This means that $b=1$ as well. </p>
        <p>We follow similar steps to show that $c=1$ because $AD$ is also a median. It follows that
          $$d=e=1+1=2$$

because of mass point addition.
        </p>
        <p>Now we consider the relationship between $AP$ and $PD$. This problem is simple enough that we don't need to compare ratios algebraically, so instead we'll use the seesaw analogy from the theory section. Remember that the mass of each point is inversely proportional to its distance from the fulcrum.</p>
        <p>Let $P$ be the fulcrum of "seesaws" $AD$ and $CE$. Since $a$ is half the mass of $d$, $a$ must be twice as far away from the fulcrum. This means that $AP=4$ because we're given that $PD=2$.</p>
        <p>Likewise, we see that $E$ must be half as far away from the fulcrum as $C$ because $E$ has twice the mass of $C$. This means that $CP=3$ because $EP=1.5$.</p>
        <p>Almost there. Note that $\triangle DPE$ is just a $3-4-5$ right triangle scaled down by one-half, where $\angle DPE = 90^\circ$. This means that the diagonals of $AEDC$ are perpendicular. Therefore, its area is 

$$\frac{AD \cdot CE}{2} = \frac{4.5(6)}{2}=\boxed{13.5}.$$

(The area of $AECD$ can also be found by adding up areas of the four right triangles comprising it.)</p>

$$\frac{BL}{AL}=\frac{BC}{AC}\Rightarrow\frac{BL}{AL}=\frac{300}{450}\Rightarrow 3BL=2AL$$ </p>
