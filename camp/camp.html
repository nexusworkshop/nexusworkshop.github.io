      <h1>Calculus Camp</h1>
      <em
        >An online, two-week crash course covering the basics of limits, derivatives, and integrals with a nontraditional approach. This camp is not a standard high school single-variable calculus course, although it will cover similar topics. Instead, our camp will aim to teach these concepts in an intuitive manner before presenting them in a more rigorous, proof-based way. Our goal is for all students to gain an understanding and appreciation of the elegance of calculus.</em
      >
      <p>
        Prerequisites: A solid background in algebra and trigonometry. Completion of a standard precalculus course is recommended but not required. The application includes a short diagnostic that all applicants who have not taken precalculus must fill out.
      </p>
      <h1>üåµ In a Nutshell üåµ</h1>
      <p><b>2021 Camp Dates: June 28-July 9</b></p>
      <p>We'll use Google Classroom to distribute course materials, Google Meet for live events, and Discord/email for communication purposes. Accepted students who don't already have a Discord account will be asked to create one - it's really simple.</p>
      <p>
          Each day of our camp will include:
          <ul>
              <li>A self-paced <b>handout</b></li>
              <li>A <b>problem set</b> focused on the topic of that day</li>
              <li><b>Office hours</b> for asking questions</li>
              <li>Enrichment activities, speakers, etc. in the evenings</li>
          </ul>
      <p>Time commitment: We expect participants to devote around 2 hours per handout and 2 hours per problem set. This adds up to a total of <b>4-5 hours per day</b>, including live activities.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
          We'll also be hosting the following <b>competitions</b> for students to test out their newfound calculus knowledge:
          <ul>
              <li>Differentiation Bee</li>
              <li>SET Tournament (we'll teach you how to play before we get started!)</li>
              <li>Integration Bee</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p><em>Please note that the Nexus camp will running according to an Eastern Standard Time schedule. We welcome students regardless of where they live and will try to work around timezone differences, but please keep in mind that you may not be able to reach us if it's the middle of the night EST.</em></p>
