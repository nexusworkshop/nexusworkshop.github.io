      <h1>Calculus Camp Application Test</h1>
      <h3>
        Updated June 1, 2021: It was recently brought to our attention that
        there has been some confusion with problem 2. Thus, we have replaced it
        with a similar question for future applicants. If you already have a
        solution for the old problem, you do NOT need to try the new one and can
        just submit what you already have.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Here is the application test for our
        <a href="/camp/camp.html">Calculus Camp</a>. This test is intended to be
        difficult and we do NOT expect applicants to be able to solve all the
        problems. Even if you get stuck on a problem, please still show your
        thought process. We are mainly interested in your ability to think
        mathematically and express your ideas on paper.
        <b
          >As such, the use of calculators or outside resources (i.e. textbooks)
          is prohibited.</b
        >
        Good luck and enjoy the problems!
      </p>
      <h3>Problem 1</h3>
      <p>
        Simplify the fraction $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{x-4\sqrt{x-4}}}$$ so that there
        are no square roots in the denominator of your answer.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem 2</h3>
      <p>
        Simplify the following expression:
        $$\log(20^{21})+\log\left({10^{2^{0^{2^1}}}}\right).$$ In this problem,
        $a^{b^c}=a^{(b^c)}$.
      </p>
      <h3>Problem 3</h3>
      <p>
        Region $R$ contains all of the points $(x,y)$ with $x,y>0$ such that
        $x+y\le \frac{13\pi}{2}$ and $\cos(x+y)\ge 0$. Find the area of $R$.
