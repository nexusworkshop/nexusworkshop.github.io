              Cindy is a high school junior from NJ. She is an AIME qualifier, a
              school math team captain, and earned a 5 on the 2020 AP Calculus
              BC exam. She has been a dedicated math participant since 4th grade
              and hopes to inspire more girls to pursue STEM subjects.

              Beyond running Nexus, she loves to read, play the piano, roller
              skate, bullet journal, and play ice hockey (among many other
              things.) If she still has time left, she occupies it by trying to
              become an amateur poet.
