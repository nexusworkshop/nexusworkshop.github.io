              Have you ever spent hours pouring over a math concept only for it
              to remain as undecipherable as hieroglyphics? We've all been
              there, and that's why we take pride in Nexus' clear step-by-step
              explanations of every math concept and example problem. We won't
              skip steps, and we keep prerequisites at a minimum. Each of our
              articles takes dozens of hours to write before being carefully
              proofread. We value accuracy, so that's why you should definitely
              let us know if you find an error.

          Nexus was built with learners in mind. This means that we do our
          absolute best to make our site as informative, accessible, and easy to
          navigate as possible. All of our articles are broken down into
          bite-sized pieces. It's even possible for you to learn on the go - if
          you don't have enough time to read the whole article, just open a
          single toggle!

          We know that spending hours staring at math textbooks comprised of
          dead tree can be incredibly boring and overwhelming, so our articles
          aim to fix that. So we've got the solution! We've highlighted and
          color-coded all the important stuff for you so that you no longer have
          to worry about picking out details while your brain is being bombarded
          with information. Our site is both minimalistic and aesthetic, and we
          hope that the occasional splash of color will help boost learners'
          motivation.

          Yes, we know. Every site claims to be home to a special community. But
          we also know that online communities can easily become toxic. The
          Nexus team believes that learning math should feel inspiring, not
          oppressive. That's why we've created a carefully moderated Discord
          Server for those who join our mailing list. The term "mathletes" was
          coined for a reason, and we believe that all members of the math
          community have a responsibility to support each other. Everyone
          belongs here, no matter your skill level or contest scores.
